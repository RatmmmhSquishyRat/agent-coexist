## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-22

Initial release.

### Added

- Eleven base commands over four local Markdown collaboration file types
  (`.agent-besties.md`): `list`, `check`, `profile`, `post`, `subscribe`,
  `brief`, `state`, `read-notification`, `lookfor-comment`, `read-brief`,
  `check-state`.
- Raw-byte parsing with splice-based writes: unknown hand-written content,
  original line endings and untouched bytes are preserved; only the ranges a
  command targets change.
- Cooperative file locking between `agent-coexist` processes (shared reads,
  exclusive writes, bounded waits with fast-fail/queue budgets), directory
  walking with gitignore-family rules, brief-target SHA-256 verification
  with fresh/shifted/stale/unchecked states, and directory-state conflict
  detection with functional locks for `profile`/`brief` writes.
- Three optional wait commands (`wait`, `wait-post`, `wait-state`) that poll
  a single collaboration file until its first change: without a projection
  filter any change ends the wait (including byte-only format changes),
  while `wait-post --as <nick>` / `wait-state --status <name>` end it only
  on changes qualifying for that nick or status; each result reports the
  change with `bytes` and `semantic` rows. Ctrl-C cancels with exit 130.
- Structured first-line/status output with two-space column rows,
  diagnostics with `why`/`fix`, stderr-only progress, and exit codes
  0/1/2/3 (+130 for cancelled waits).
